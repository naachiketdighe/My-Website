For my year in review, I would like to discuss the experiences that had the most significant impact on me last year, particularly an acting class I took during the fall semester. This class taught me a lot about myself, both as a person and as an actor. A large part of the class was dedicated to self-exploration, which was quite different from my usual college experience. As a Computer Science major, we rarely focus on our relationship with ourselves, but this class provided that opportunity.

One of the most impactful exercises we did involved a 'physical wash' of the body, which included tracing our palms along our bodies while practicing controlled breathing. Another exercise was a meditative practice with controlled breathing at the start of each class. These exercises not only helped relieve my stress after a long day but also improved my focus. I now rely on these techniques to feel better and more prepared, whether I’m learning something new or starting my day before heading to class.

Another experience that significantly influenced my goals was my co-op with Delta Air Lines, where I worked as a Data Science co-op. I developed a website demo for a proof-of-concept version of Delta's internal document search engine, akin to Google's. I also had the opportunity to present my project to various stakeholders at Delta Air Lines. During those three months, I learned several important tools, including AWS, ElasticSearch, and Vectorization. This experience also opened the door for me to work in Data Science, as I learned to implement vector search in my proof of concept, enabling users to search with multiple keywords for more specific results. Currently, I am back working with the same team, enjoying the work I’ve done so far and what they have planned for me.

My goals for this year and the next are to gain as much knowledge as possible about my industry to be fully prepared for work when I graduate next year. To achieve this, I have already started following standard Agile and Git protocols at work and ensuring proper documentation of my work
